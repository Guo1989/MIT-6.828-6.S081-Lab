When multiple threads insert into the same bucket simultaneously, with no lock to protect the invariant that table[i] points to the head of the ith bucket, some entries might be lost.
The sequence is:
1 thread a read table[i]
2 thread b read table[i]
3 thread a insert entry x to table[i]
4 thread b insert entry y to table[i]
we can see entry x is lost.
